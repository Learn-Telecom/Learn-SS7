# CAS - Channel Associated Signaling

SS5 - On CCS type of channel the signaling traffic is carried with voice path. totally insecure, can be manipulated injecting tons inside the channel.

Analog, T1 RBS, E1 R2

#### CAS - Channel Associated Signaling

Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) is a method used in telecommunications where signaling information is conveyed within the same channel as the voice or data.&#x20;

This is achieved by using specific bits in the data stream to carry signaling information such as on-hook, off-hook, and dialed digits.&#x20;

In CAS, each telephone circuit has its own associated signaling, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased complexity compared to other signaling methods like Common Channel Signaling (CCS). CAS is typically used in analog networks, T1 Robbed Bit Signaling (RBS), and E1 R2 systems.
