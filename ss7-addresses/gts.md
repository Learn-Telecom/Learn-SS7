# ðŸŸ¢ GTs

**SS7 Global Titles**

In the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) network, Global Titles (GTs) are unique addresses used to identify network services and facilitate routing of signaling messages. GTs are assigned to network elements such as mobile switching centers, databases, and gateways.&#x20;

Typically, a GT is represented in a format similar to an international phone number, enabling the conversion of dialed numbers into routable addresses across different network domains.&#x20;

This is essential for supporting services like number translation, mobile roaming, and SMS delivery across telecommunication networks.

**Structure and Format of Global Titles**

Global Titles in SS7 are structured using various digits and formats, often resembling the E.164 numbering plan used for international phone numbers. The GT format can vary depending on the network requirements and the function of the network element it identifies. There are different types of GTs, such as:

1. **GT Type 1 (E.164 Number Format):** Aligns with the international public telecommunications numbering plan.
2. **GT Type 2 (E.212 IMSI Format):** Utilized for identifying mobile subscribers via the International Mobile Subscriber Identity.
3. **GT Type 3 (Translation Type, TT):** Tailored for scenarios requiring translation into other numbering formats.
4. **GT Type 4 (Unique Network Identification):** Used for applications needing unique identification not covered by the other formats.

These GT types enable efficient routing and ensure seamless communication between different network segments, which is crucial for global connectivity and the support of various telecommunication services.
