# Location Tracking

The SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) utilizes the MAP (Mobile Application Part) protocol to facilitate communication in mobile networks.&#x20;

Through MAP, network elements exchange signaling messages, which can include location updates about mobile subscribers. When a subscriber's mobile device connects to a cell tower, its new location is registered in the network's home location register (HLR) via MAP messages.

Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the SS7 network to intercept these MAP messages and determine a subscriber's location.&#x20;

This exposure underscores the importance of securing SS7 infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive location data.

#### **MAP Messages**

The term "UpdateLocationResUpdateLocationArgMAP" likely refers to a function or method signature in a programming context. Here's a breakdown of the components:

* **UpdateLocationRes**: This could be a response object indicating the result of an attempt to update a location. It may contain information about whether the update was successful and any relevant status messages or data.
* **UpdateLocationArg**: This might be an argument or parameter passed to a function that specifies the details necessary to update the location, such as the new coordinates or address.
* **MAP**: This could imply a mapping, such as a data structure (e.g., a dictionary or map) that holds key-value pairs related to location updates.

Overall, this may represent a method that updates location data using specific arguments.

#### Standards

* 3GPP TS 09.02 (MAP v1, MAP v2)
* 3GPP TS 29.002 (MAP v3) - MAP for 3G UMTS & GSM (Release 99 and later)
