# ðŸŸ¢ MTP1

#### **SS7 MTP1 Layer**

The MTP1 (Message Transfer Part Level 1) layer of the SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) protocol stack provides the physical and electrical characteristics for signaling. It operates at the data link level, handling bit-level transmission over the communication medium.&#x20;

MTP1 ensures the reliable transfer of signaling messages between network nodes by managing signal encoding, synchronization, and error detection, and it is often compared to the physical layer in the OSI model.
